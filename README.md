<h2>Introduction</h2>
"From Scratch" Drone Using Teensy 3.2 and Arduino.
I wanted to build a drone frome scratch to see if it was possible (or better yet if I could do it). I not only 
wanted to build the code but also the frame, circuit board and pretty much anything that could go into it. 
This was a way to learn C++ and Autocad but also to get into circuit board design and some of the electrical engineering aspects.

<h2>Current Issues</h2>
Pretty Much Everything :)
